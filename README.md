# MRT Delay Data

Hi fellow redditors ! We are two fellow r/sg redditors ( u/Sproinkerino & u/captmomo) wanted to work on a mini-project to improve our programming/analytics skills. We would like to share with you guys the work that we have done! We are pretty much new to this so any feedback is pretty much appreciated.
## 1) Data Scrapping from SMRT Twitter

Using python, we scraped SMRT's twitter feed to gather the delay/breakdown data in the past 5 years. The data is then cleaned to obtain the delays for specific lines and stations.

## 2) Data Visualization with R

Next we used ggplot2/ggmaps in R to obtain a map plot of all the different stations along with the number of delays.

## 3) Here is the plot: https://imgur.com/a/b7D728p

The darker the node the more delays the station had experienced.

## 4) Data Summary

|   |   |
|:--|:--|
|Station with most number of breakdown|NS16 Ang Mo Kio
Line with most number of breakdowns|North South Line	
Line with least number of breakdowns|Down Town Line

## 5) Mini-Webapp to find probability of a delay

We also created a fun little webapp to find the probability of delay when travelling from 1 station to another !

We hope this mini-project was interesting to you guys ! Any feedback will be greatly appreciated ! :)
